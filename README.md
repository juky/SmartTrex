# SmartTrex

Machine learning AI that aims to complete Chrome's "no network" t-rex game flawlessly

We got our inspiration from this video https://goo.gl/itxZIe.

We are trying to make this project in 2months from scratch only using c++. 
This a homemade project of 2students. Intrested in using github and learning c++.

Why c++?

Well, we never worked with c++ before, and like to learn the language by creating this project. But we do have some experience with other languages like C#.
