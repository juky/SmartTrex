# SmartTrex

Machine learning AI that aims to complete Chrome's "no network" t-rex game flawlessly

We got our inspiration from this video https://goo.gl/itxZIe.

We are trying to make this project in two months from scratch using only c++. 
This is a homemade project of two students. Interested getting more familiar with github and learning c++.

Why c++?

Well, we have never worked with c++ before, and would like to learn the language by creating this project. We do have some experience with other languages like C#.
