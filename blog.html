  <h5>Other</h5>
    <p>Today I searched the web for some usable code, like how people would take screenshots and put it in a file using c++.</p>

  <h5>Get screen size (Vector2)</h5>
    <p>Today I found the command "GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN)" to get the count of pixels in the screen some problem was it was giving me the wrong value</p>
    <p>I found out that you first need to declare to the OS that it knows about DPI using the command "SetProcessDPIAware()".</p>
	
    <h5>Get all pixels in an array</h5>
	<p>This is done by the following code.</p><img href="x">

  <h5>Git</h5>
  <p>As it turns out git is a little more complicated than I had anticipated. I was hoping to just enter some random commands into CLI and get it running exactly the way I wanted to.<p>
  <p>We did get everything up and running the way we wanted it to, and if you're reading this, everything works. I'm using git via ssh/shell to edit this message. I will have to catch up with Ruben on c++ though.</p>

	<h5>Get window size of the game (Vector2)</h5>
	<p>This was done by first seeing where the ground line was opposite of the dino, then I would see when a white pixel would start, then I added some functions to check if it just wasn't cactus or hill by checking how long the white space lasted, and by checking the shape.</p>
	<img href="x">
   <h5>Get dino position (Vector2)</h5>
	<p>We just simply used 4for lusses (xy for whole screen pixels and xy for dinoImage) to compare the pixels with each other. Not the best solution but this isn't really the main point of the project so it will do the job.</p>
	
	<p>We had some problems where a function returned the first pointer to an RGBQUAD array with pixels with the size of the array, the size because after returing the array sizeof() woudln't be working anymore</p>
	<p>After we got this running we had a weird issue where some of the last RGBQUAD array's values would change.</p>
	<p>In our example this would happen after excuting the command cout.</p>
	<p>I found a solution by returning a vector<RGBQUAD> instad of an RGBQUAD array with the size/p>
	<p>By the pos of the dino and width of the floor you can draw a rect of the area we will need to check alot. Like in the image below.</p>

  <h5>Update -> read each pixel in window</h5>
    <p>Not alot has changed with the prev version just that now instead of an "RGBQUAD[]" it will return a "vector<RGBQUAD>"</p>
