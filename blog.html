<h4> Ruben </h4>
  <h5>Other</h5>
    <p>Today I searched the web for some usable code, like how people would take screenshots and put it in a file using c++.</p>

  <h5>Get screen size (Vector2)</h5>
    <p>Today I found the command "GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN)" to get the count of pixels in the screen some problem was it was giving me the wrong value</p>
    <p>I found out that you first need to declare to the OS that it knows about DPI using the command "SetProcessDPIAware()".</p>
	
    <h5>Get all pixels in an array</h5>
	<p>This is done by the following code.</p><img href="x">

  <h5>Git</h5>
  <p>As it turns out git is a little more complicated than I had anticipated. I was hoping to just enter some random commands into CLI and get it running exactly the way I wanted to.<p>
  <p>We did get everything up and running the way we wanted it to, and if you're reading this, everything works. I'm using git via ssh/shell to edit this message. I will have to catch up with Ruben on c++ though.</p>
